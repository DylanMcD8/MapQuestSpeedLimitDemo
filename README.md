# MapQuest Speed Limit Demo
A simple demo app that demonstrates getting current Speed Limit data from the MapQuest Navigation SDK.

Remember to get your [free dev key](https://developer.mapquest.com). You will need this to run the app.

Read more about MapQuest's Navigation SDK [here](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/nav-sdk/ios/v3.5/).

Note: the app IS IN SWIFT, GitHub only identifies it as Objective-C because of the MapQuest-provided framwork code.
